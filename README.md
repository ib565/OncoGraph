## What It Does

Ask questions like *"Which genes predict resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancer?"* and get:
- **Clinical evidence** with PMIDs from curated databases (CIViC, OpenTargets)
- **Pathway enrichment analysis** with one-click biological interpretation
- **AI-generated summaries** explaining mechanisms and significance
- **Suggested follow-up queries** to continue exploring the knowledge graph

Built on **Neo4j** + **fine-tuned LLMs** for text-to-Cypher translation. Results are traceable, exportable, and validated against clinical evidence.

## Why OncoGraph?

| Task | Manual Approach | OncoGraph |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| Find resistance biomarkers | Search CIViC → read 20+ evidence items | Natural language query → results with PMIDs |
| Understand mechanism | Read papers → search pathway databases | One-click enrichment + AI summary |
| Find alternative targets | Formulate hypothesis → search again | Suggested follow-up queries |
| **Time per iteration** | **30-60 minutes** | **5-7 minutes** |

**The value is integration:** Reduce friction at every step of the discovery loop.

## Complete Workflow Example

### KRAS Resistance in Colorectal Cancer

This demonstrates OncoGraph's end-to-end workflow for understanding therapy resistance and finding alternatives.

**Step 1: Identify Resistance Mechanisms**  
Query: *"Which genes predict resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab in colorectal cancer?"*  
→ **Result:** 13 genes (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PIK3CA, etc.) with 88 evidence items across 45 PMIDs

**Step 2: Understand Biological Mechanism**  
Action: Click "Move to Functional Enrichment"  
→ **Result:** Enrichment in ErbB signaling pathway (p < 1e-19)  
→ **AI Summary:** "These genes converge on receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Dysregulation allows tumor cells to maintain proliferative signals despite EGFR blockade."

**Step 3: Find Alternative Therapeutic Targets**  
Action: Click suggested query *"Which therapies target ERBB2, MAP2K1, or PIK3CA?"*  
→ **Result:** ERBB2 inhibitors (trastuzumab, pertuzumab), MEK inhibitors (trametinib, cobimetinib), PI3K inhibitors (alpelisib, copanlisib)

**Insight:** Patients with anti-EGFR resistance may benefit from combination strategies targeting downstream pathways.

**Time:** ~7 minutes from question to actionable hypothesis | **Manual equivalent:** 45-60 minutes

## What Problem Does This Solve?

When computational models predict a gene signature affects drug response, researchers need to:
1. **Validate** - Is this finding supported by clinical evidence?
2. **Interpret** - What biological mechanism explains this pattern?
3. **Act** - What therapies target this mechanism?

This typically requires hours of manual work across multiple tools.

**OncoGraph integrates the entire workflow:**
- Query clinical evidence in natural language
- Interpret biological mechanisms via pathway enrichment
- Explore therapeutic options through the knowledge graph
- All with traceable sources and exportable results

**Complements AI discovery platforms:** When models (e.g., Noetik's OCTO) predict gene signatures from spatial data, OncoGraph validates them against clinical evidence, interprets the mechanism, and identifies therapeutic options

## Scientific Validation

OncoGraph has been validated against established clinical findings:

**KRAS Mutations in Anti-EGFR Therapy**  
Correctly identified 28+ KRAS variants (G12D, G12V, G13D, etc.) predicting cetuximab resistance in colorectal cancer. Cross-referenced with landmark study PMID:17363584 (Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008).

**BRAF-Targeted Therapies**  
Matches FDA-approved BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib, vemurafenib, encorafenib) and current NCCN guidelines for BRAF-mutant cancers.

*OncoGraph is a research tool. Validate all results against primary literature before clinical application.*

## Fine-Tuned Models (Text-to-Cypher)

OncoGraph includes **fine-tuned LLMs** that translate natural language oncology questions directly into Cypher queries:

| Model | Accuracy | Latency | Best For |
|-------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Qwen3-4B-Oncograph** | 91.25% | ~14s | Highest accuracy |
| **Qwen3-1.7B-Oncograph** | 72.5% | ~9.9s | Speed/accuracy balance |

**📊 [View comprehensive evaluation results →](https://ib565.github.io/OncoGraph/model_evaluation_report.html)**

**Documentation:** [Overview](docs/FINETUNING_OVERVIEW.md) | [Technical Details](docs/FINETUNING_DETAILS.md)

Models available on Hugging Face as 16-bit merged models (vLLM-compatible) and LoRA adapters. *Note: Fine-tuned models not yet deployed; looking for cost-effective inference options.*

## Voice Agent

OncoGraph includes a **voice-enabled query interface** that lets you ask questions about the knowledge graph using natural speech. The voice agent uses a fast-path architecture with pre-written Cypher templates to achieve **sub-2-second response times** for common query patterns.

**Key features:**
- **10 query types** with template-based execution (resistance biomarkers, therapy targets, gene variants, etc.)
- **Entity normalization** handles common variations (KRAS/kras, Erbitux/cetuximab) automatically
- **Conversational interface** via Gemini Flash with Deepgram STT and Cartesia TTS
- **Structured results** optimized for voice output (top 3–5 items, 1–3 sentences)

**Status:** Voice agent is implemented and tested locally but **not yet deployed** due to inference budget constraints. The standard web interface remains fully functional.

**Documentation:** [Voice Agent README](voice_agent/README.md) — Architecture, setup, and technical details

**Demo:** Interested in seeing the voice agent in action? [Reach out for a demo](mailto:ish.bhartiya@gmail.com).

## Example Queries & Gene Lists

### Curated Example Queries (Frontend)

The frontend includes **10 high-impact example queries** organized into three tabs:

1. **Therapy & Targets** — Queries about therapy mechanisms and target genes
2. **Biomarkers & Resistance** — Queries about predictive biomarkers and resistance mechanisms
3. **Evidence & Precision** — Queries about evidence levels and precision medicine

These examples are stored in `web/app/data/exampleQueries.json` and can include **pre-computed cached responses** for instant loading. When you click an example with a cached response, results appear immediately without running the query.

**To update cached responses:**
1. Run an example query manually in the app
2. Verify the results look correct
3. Click the **"Copy Example JSON for Cache"** button (appears when the current query matches an example)
4. Paste the copied JSON into `web/app/data/exampleQueries.json`, replacing the matching entry's `cachedResponse` field
5. Commit and redeploy

### Graph Q&A Examples

**Therapy-centric:**
- Which therapies target ERBB2, and what are their mechanisms of action?
- What therapies target BRAF, and what are their modalities?

**Biomarker-centric:**
- Which KRAS variants affect response to panitumumab in colorectal cancer?
- Provide PMIDs supporting that EGFR S492R confers resistance to cetuximab

**Disease-centric:**
- List therapies with variant-level biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer
- In colorectal cancer, which ERBB2 or EGFR variants have biomarker evidence?

### Gene Lists for Functional Enrichment

**Anti-EGFR resistance (colorectal cancer):**
```
KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR, MAP2K1, ERBB2, ERBB3, PIK3CA, PTEN, FBXW7, SMAD4
```

**Immune checkpoints:**
```
PDCD1, CD274, CTLA4, LAG3, TIGIT, PRF1, GZMB
```

**MAPK pathway:**
```
KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, EGFR
```

## Local Development

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+, Neo4j, Node.js

**Quick setup:**
```bash
# 1. Setup Python environment
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .

# 2. Ingest CIViC & OpenTargets data
python -m src.pipeline.civic_ingest --out-dir data/civic/latest --enrich-tags

# 3. Seed database
python -m src.graph.builder

# 4. Install frontend dependencies (once)
cd web && npm install && cd ..

# 5. Install dev tooling (once; installs concurrently)
npm install

# 6. Start both backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 3000)
npm run dev
```

Already ran `npm install` inside `web/`? You're set—repeat step 3 only when the UI package.json changes. Step 4 still needs to run once at the project root to pull in the root-level tooling.

Prefer separate terminals instead of the combined command?
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd web && npm run dev
```

**Environment variables:** Create `.env` with `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`

See [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](docs/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md) for full setup instructions, testing, and architecture details
